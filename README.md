# Advent of Code 2020

This repo contains my solutions to this year's Advent of Code.

For each day there are a .txt file for the given input, and a markdown file. The markdown file is generated from a jupyter notebook (.ipynb) file. The reason for this is that with .ipynb files there is a lot of metadata, and this results in large commits for small changes (especially if there are plots and/or images in the output). In the markdown files only the code is saved, which makes for smaller commits. The conversion (and syncing between .ipynb and .md) is done by https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext. Very nice.
